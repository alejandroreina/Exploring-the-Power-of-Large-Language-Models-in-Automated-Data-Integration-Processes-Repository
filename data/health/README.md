The original source of this data belongs to La Fe Hospital in Valencia. However, tt is important to note that the data presented here are not real; they have been randomly modified and shuffled to ensure no correlation with any actual patient. Nevertheless, these data retain the structure and semantics of genuine medical case tables. 

Specifically, the datasets encompass a variety of subjects such as drug dispensations and prescriptions, pregnancy-related data, pharmaceuticals administered in a hospital setting, blood test results, patient comorbidities, PCR test outcomes, demographic details of patients, admissions to intensive care units and hospitals, records from home healthcare units, and emergency medical service cases. 

All information is purely illustrative and should not be used as a basis for real-world medical decisions or patient identification.
